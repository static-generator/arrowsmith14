Bands I listen to: 
--------
![Nirvana](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/29/1377773568192/nirvana-008.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none)
--------
I definitely have no favorite songs through this band since majority of them are so good like I almost have all of their songs through my playlist. 
-------
![Hole](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c5/Hole_-_Live_Through_This.png) 
-------
This is the land I listen to through my lowest; I blast out their songs in loud volume especially their song " I think that I would die "
-------
![Metallica](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Metallica_March_2024.jpg/1200px-Metallica_March_2024.jpg)
-------
Just like Hole, this is another band that I listen to through my lowest especially when I'm angry or stressed out, My favorite album from them was ' Ride the Lightning "
------
![Paramore](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aCyGvGEtOwc/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEhCK4FEIIDSFryq4qpAxMIARUAAAAAGAElAADIQj0AgKJD&rs=AOn4CLDwbY5b3lbloF4qM6Wttq_TYjZHrA)
------
I don't really know what to say about this one, but one of my music box members convinced me to listen to one of them and overall a really good one 
------
And lastly:

This is the first band I listened to as a kid, but when i stopped listening to music; my friend started sending me videos related to this band, and finally I started listening to them again !

## Artists: I cannot give thoughts to them anymore since I want to make this website simpler

### Something about me
![idk](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/ba/7e/72/ba7e7210dc292f623affdf32ff93c228.jpg) I'm chronically online sometimes, I like playing computer games too like Roblox and Minecraft. I like drawing digitally and animate them simply, thus I had a tiktok account with 1.5k plus followers but I don't really post anymore; since I got lazy heres the account if you want to check it out: [@1st_eery](https://www.tiktok.com/@1st_eery?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc) . Im sensitive to violent movies especially with gore in them so don't convince me to watch them even though my age is suitable for them ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“. I had a few Best friends with me those I only trusted. I'd rather be myself than changing for people especially when trying to fit in with them and I don't like that. Before I end here I wanna say this; as a Gen Z im different, I actually like dad's music taste not only it sounds nostalgic; it also comforts me without telling people my problems; because I'm scared to open up with people nowadays.
